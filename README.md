In this example, we will go through the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, in which we will predict the profit of startups for a venture capitalist who wants to analyse whether a startup is worth investing to get good returns.


What is Multiple Linear Regression?
Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that is used to predict the outcome of a variable based on the value of two or more variables. It is sometimes known simply as multiple regression, and it is an extension of linear regression. The variable that we want to predict is known as the dependent variable, while the variables we use to predict the value of the dependent variable are known as independent or explanatory variables
